## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- Can persist state in vanilla JS by using let
  ```js
  let imgNum = 1
  img++ //imgNum => 2
  ```
- Learnt manual installation / usage of tailwind
- css aspect ratio
```html
<div class="aspect-1/4">
```

### Useful resources

- [TW Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/) - Needed to refer back to docs for things like background images, custom breakpoints etc
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26107125/cannot-read-property-addeventlistener-of-null) - one of the answers I refferred to by Dilip Agheda which helped with my JS.
